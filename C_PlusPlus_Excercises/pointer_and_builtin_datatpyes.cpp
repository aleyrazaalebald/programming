/*
* This progam explains about address of operator (&). its say that the address-of operator (&) doesnâ€™t return the address of its operand as a 
literal. Instead, it returns a pointer containing the address of the operand-

The size of a pointer is dependent upon the architecture the executable is compiled for a 32-bit executable uses 32-bit memory addresses 
consequently, a pointer on a 32-bit machine is 32 bits (4 bytes). With a 64-bit executable, a pointer would be 64 bits (8 bytes). 
Note that this is true regardless of the size of the object being pointed to:

    std::cout << "typeid(&x).name() = " << typeid(&x).name() << '\n'; // on x86 architecture, 64 bit Windwos 11 computer it prints typeid(&x).name() = int* __ptr64
    
    //pointer size
    char cc{'A'};    // character is on 1 byte
    double d {732.2564};    // double is of 8 bytes
